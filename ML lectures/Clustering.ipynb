_20newsgroups_dataset:\\n\\nThe 20 newsgroups text dataset\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe 20 newsgroups dataset comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on\\n20 topics split in two subsets: one for training (or development)\\nand the other one for testing (or for performance evaluation). The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n',\n"," 'data': [\"From: rogntorb@idt.unit.no (Torbj|rn Rognes)\\nSubject: Adding int. hard disk drive to IIcx\\nKeywords: Mac IIcx, internal, hard disk drive, SCSI\\nReply-To: rogntorb@idt.unit.no (Torbj|rn Rognes)\\nOrganization: Div. of CS & Telematics, Norwegian Institute of Technology\\nLines: 32\\n\\nI haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a\\nmac.

First \\nsome background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \\nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \\nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \\nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \\nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \\nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \\nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \\ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \\nsectors a week.\\n \\n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \\nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in \\nabout every 100 files are affected.  \\n \\n        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s \\nsystem, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about \\nsmartdrv to help me out.\\n\\n--                    \\nINTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)\\nUUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver\\nNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115\\n\",\n","  'From: Sven Guckes <guckes@math.fu-berlin.de>\\nSubject: Re: Looking for free/share wares\\nOriginator: guckes@medusa\\nX-Mail-Reader: Elm 2.4 PL21\\nOrganization: Free University of Berlin, Germany\\nDistribution: comp\\nX-News-Reader: NN 6.4.13 #13\\nLines: 14\\n\\nyoung@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (YOUNG Shio Hong) writes:\\n\\n>I am looking for ftp sites (where there are freewares or sharewares) for Mac.\\n>It will help a lot if there are driver source codes in those ftp sites.\\n>Any information is appreciated. \\n\\nF A Q !\\n\\nReference:\\nNewsgroups: comp.sys.mac.apps,comp.sys.mac.misc,comp.sys.mac.system,\\n\\tcomp.sys.mac.wanted,comp.sys.mac.hardware,comp.answers,news.answers\\nSubject: Introductory Macintosh frequently asked questions (FAQ)\\n\\nSven :)\\n',\n","  \"From: ardie@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu (Ardie Mack)\\nSubject: Re: does dos6 defragment??\\nArticle-I.D.: ux1.ardie.272.734097933\\nOrganization: Department of Plant Pathology\\nLines: 30\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr6.040254.8443@cs.brown.edu> ksl@engin1.NoSubdomain.NoDomain (Kiseok Lee  ) writes:\\n>From: ksl@engin1.NoSubdomain.NoDomain (Kiseok Lee  )\\n>Subject: Re: does dos6 defragment??\\n>Date: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 04:02:54 GMT\\n>In article <C51H9M.46p@news.cso.uiuc.edu>, rhc52134@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Richard) writes:\\n>|> Geoffrey S.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\\n5.41 wouldn\\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\\n\\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me\\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see\\nthe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.\\n\\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\\n\\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to again\\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\\nrecovery.)\\n\\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \\n\\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame La\\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\\nBut c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\\na letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\\'t even \\nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\\n\\nWhat\\'s the moral of this story? I\\'m not sure.

Even at the cost of needing more\\n instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,\\n faster design.\\n\\n A typical RISC processor will:\\n\\n    o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);\\n\\n    o perform all data operations on registers;\\n\\n    o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or \\'register + offset\\');\\n\\n    o only allow load & store operations to access memory;\\n\\n    o only use a few instruction formats;\\n\\n    o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).\\n\\nSteffi Beckhaus                 JANET: Steffi.Beckhaus@uk.ac.newcastle\\nIf the odds are a million to one against something occurring, chances\\nare 50-50 it will.\\n',\n","  \"From: leo@cae.wisc.edu (Leo Lim)\\nSubject: DOS6 - doublespace + stacker 3.0, is it okay?\\nArticle-I.D.: doug.1993Apr6.133257.14570\\nOrganization: College of Engineering, Univ. of Wisconsin--Madison\\nLines: 7\\n\\nJust as the title suggest, is it okay to do that?\\nI havne't got DOS6 yet, but I heart DoubleSpace is less tight than stacker 3.0.\\nWhat are disadvantage/advantages by doing that?\\n\\nAny comments will be appreciated.\\n\\n===Martin\\n\",\n","  'From: smedley@ecst.csuchico.edu (Steven Medley)\\nSubject: 72-pin SIMMS, where?\\nDistribution: usa\\nOrganization: California State University, Chico\\nLines: 13\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: pigface.ecst.csuchico.edu\\n\\nI am looking for a 8 meg 72-pin SIMM for my Centris 610.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I\\'ll give \\nyour question a shot. \\n\\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \\nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \\n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \\npages wet.

Once \\nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \\nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \\n\\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I\\'m assuming that the DeskJet can, or \\nHP wouldn\\'t sell many......\\n\\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \\nlike a tank.

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \\nto contact me.\\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\\n\\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\\n\\n********\\n\\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \\ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \\n\\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \\nof three-dimensional molecules?\\n\\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \\nactually doing it?\\n\\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \\ndo with this package???' , read on.\\n\\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \\nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \\n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \\nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.\\n\\n\\nEnjoy,\\nChristian Franz\\n\",\n","  'From: ray@netcom.com (Ray Fischer)\\nSubject: Re: Can you share one monitor w/ 2 cpus?\\nOrganization: Netcom.

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

PEXlib is a slightly\\n\"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\\nextension to X.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\\n- Is free of \"policy\"\\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\\n\\nIf you\\'re working strictly in X and don\\'t care about things like\\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.

Three questions come to mid real quick for something like\\nthis.\\n\\nQ:\\tWhich version of Adobe PS will we clone?\\n\\tAside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released\\n\\tnew code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other\\n\\tsoftware vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure\\n\\tyou,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to\\n\\tdwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to\\n\\tmaintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.\\n\\nQ:\\tDo we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?\\n\\tFrom the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had\\n\\ta number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding\\n\\twhich approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.\\n\\nQ:\\tDo we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?\\n\\tWithout a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's\\n\\tPS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does\\n\\tleave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be\\n\\tnice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two\\n\\tdifferent implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given\\n\\tan identical set of conditions.\\n\\nQ:\\tPSCRIPT.DRV?\\n\\tHaving done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of\\n\\ttesting is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary\\n\\tsource we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,\\n\\t(1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,\\n\\tbut the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe\\n\\tuses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its\\n\\twrong.\\n\\nYes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub\\nof Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack\\nof design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor\\nbecause the vendors don't know what PS is.\\n\\nDon Newbold\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdon@rastek.com\\n\",\n","  \"From: choo@ecs.umass.edu\\nSubject: TechWorks -- What You Say?\\nLines: 19\\n\\n\\n\\nGreetings!!\\n\\n\\tI'm planning to upgrade my Mac IIsi:\\n\\n\\t\\t(1) from the present 5Megs to 17Megs;\\n\\tand\\t(2) add a Math-Coprocessor.\\n\\n\\tTechnology Works, of Austin (Texas) comes quite highly recommended by \\nsome Mac magazines.

PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:\\nhere are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with\\nthis and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation.

The machine is 3 years old\\nand I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for\\ntwo and a half years. The disk recently crashed.

On the third reformat and after\\nreinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes\\n2,3, and 4 with no errors.

You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\\n    slots.\\n\\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\\n\\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\\n\\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\\n\\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\\n\\t\\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\\n\\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\\n\\n\",\n","  'From: chakaw@stein.u.washington.edu (Chak-Yoon Aw)\\nSubject: Is there any documentation for Microsoft Diagnostics?\\nArticle-I.D.: shelley.1qk9uqINNh0s\\nDistribution: na\\nOrganization: University of Washington, Seattle\\nLines: 10\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: stein.u.washington.edu\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI found what I believe is an undocumented feature in my windows directory,\\nMicrosoft Diagnostics, ver 2.00.

The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which\\nresults in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA\\nmonitor.\\n\\n***************************************************************************\\nThis message was created on MCW BBS a jointly supported by\\nNew Orleans Mac User Group & National Home & School User Group\\nuser@maccomw.uucp        The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.\\n***************************************************************************\\n\",\n","  'From: \"james kewageshig\" <james.kewageshig@canrem.com>\\nSubject: articles on flocking?\\nReply-To: \"james kewageshig\" <james.kewageshig@canrem.com>\\nOrganization: Canada Remote Systems\\nDistribution: comp\\nLines: 17\\n\\nHI All,\\nCan someone point me towards some articles on \\'boids\\' or\\nflocking algorithms... ?\\n\\nAlso, articles on particle animation formulas would be nice...\\n ________________________________________________________________________\\n|0 ___ ___  ____  ____  ____                                            0|\\\\\\n|   \\\\ \\\\//    ||    ||    ||                James Kewageshig              |\\\\|\\n|   _\\\\//_   _||_  _||_  _||_      UUCP: james.kewageshig@canrem.com      |\\\\|\\n|   N E T W O R K    V I I I    FIDONET:   James Kewageshig - 1:229/15   |\\\\|\\n|0______________________________________________________________________0|\\\\|\\n \\\\________________________________________________________________________\\\\|\\n---\\n þ DeLuxeý 1.25 #8086 þ Head of Co*& XV$# Hi This is a signature virus.

The default value STACKS=9,256\\n  does just fine.\\n- Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a\\n  256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning\\n  off the hardware scroll (\"24xmode scrolloff\") before entering the graphics\\n  mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.\\n  With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the\\n  window.\\n- The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware\\n  cursor). I don\\'t know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.\\n  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-\\n  for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-\\n  unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?\\n- The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode.

I'm writing an application for the PC that may have at most 256\\ncolors. I want to use one colormap (palette) for the application but I'd like\\nit to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum. I could use \\na 6x6x6 RGB cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost\\nidentical to the human eye. \\n\\nDoes anyone know how I can optimize my choice of colors ?\\n\",\n","  'From: gmich@is.morgan.com (George Michaels)\\nSubject: NTSC and th\\nNntp-Posting-Host: idt114\\nOrganization: Morgan Stanley & Company\\nDistribution: comp\\nLines: 0\\n\\n',\n","  'From: rrn@po.CWRU.Edu (Robert R.

The big problems I have encountered in\\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\\n\\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n","  'From: cptnerd@access.digex.com (Captain Nerd)\\nSubject: \"SIMM Re-use\" NuBus board...

The directory entry, the FAT chain,\\nand the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined\\nnotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.\\n\\nThe directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,\\nand first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that\\'s not\\nimportant right now.\\n\\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find\\nthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the\\nnumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it\\nholds a \"magic\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad\\n(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster\\ncontains the next section of the file.\\n\\nThe data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.\\nThe data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is\\ndoled out in \"chunks\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster\\nis 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.\\n\\nTo read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the\\nstarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.\\nNext, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will\\ntell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.\\nNaturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump\\naround and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a\\ntime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker\\nwhich says it\\'s the last cluster in the file.\\n\\nCHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of\\nthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into\\nsubmission.  It doesn\\'t have any intelligence, so you have to\\ndouble-check anything it \"fixes\".\\n\\nNow let\\'s do a bit of a post-mortem:\\n\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\CVPIC.EXE\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VPIC.TXT\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VIDEO7.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\ORCPRO2.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VGA.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GAME\\\\GOOSE\\\\BIRD2.X\\n>C:\\\\WINMISC\\\\ADV21\\\\WINADV.EXE\\n>   Allocation error, size adjusted\\n\\nAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don\\'t match\\nthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter\\nthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the\\ndirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.\\nBut CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,\\nobviously, are made up.))\\n\\n>   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains.\\n>    647168 bytes disk space would be freed\\n\\nDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached\\nto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these\\n\"lost chains\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK\\nthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell\\nCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply\\nbe marked \"available\" in the FAT.\\n\\n\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\CVPIC.EXE\\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\\n\\n...\\n\\n>C:\\\\386SPART.PAR\\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\\n\\nThese files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,\\none of them (at least) must be wrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that\\nC:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...\\n\\nTo fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.\\nThis will \"fix\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.\\nNow delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to\\nassemble them properly.  Good luck.

This may be the actual cause of\\nthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an\\namount which exceeded available disk space...\\n\\nIn any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.\\nThere are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage\\nafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the\\nproblem occurs.

This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\\'85-\\'89), the PI\\n(\\'88-\\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\\'s - \\'86-\\'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems (\\'88-\\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon\\'t, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\\'t wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it\\'s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\\n|> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\\n|> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\\n|> just before the end of the quarter), but I\\'m just a little tired of\\n|> getting boned in the process.\\n|> \\n\\nIf that\\'s happening, it\\'s becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n|> Maybe it\\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\\n|> aren\\'t entitled to a \"peek under the covers\" as the Big Kids (NASA,\\n|> for instance) are.

Apparently the process of expanding\\neach frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate\\nbit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work\\npretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x\\nsize or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.\\n\\n>   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra\\n(don't know\\n>what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the\\nQuicktime\\n>could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\\n\\nHe lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by\\nthe fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the\\nsame amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in\\norder to keep the sound and video synced up.\\n\\nThe Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar\\nperformance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally\\nfaster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.\\n\\n>   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was\\nhaving\\n>a little bit of trouble.

One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly\\ntwice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.\\nThe Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice\\nspeakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,\\nthe QT player Apple includes with the software.\\n\\n>   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\\n\\nNo problem -- it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the\\nthings it does as well as it can.\\n========================================================================\\nSean McMains              | Check out the Gopher    | Phone:817.565.2039\\nUniversity of North Texas | New Bands Info server   | Fax  :817.565.4060\\nP.O.

These objects are all freely\\n  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.\\n\\n  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file\\n  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the\\n  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially\\n  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various\\n  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,\\n  Rayshade 4.0, or vort.

What I have seen from the March Beta is\\nthat it doesn\\'t yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user\\nfeatures. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn\\'t allow\\ntwo users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user\\nper console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. \\n\\nI believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third\\nparty. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the\\nnet. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like\\ncsh on Unix for remote logins. \\n\\nIn general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to\\nWin3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being\\nslow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems\\nalso start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was\\nright when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing\\naround with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using\\na \"business computer\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I\\nwould consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much\\ncheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides\\nthe robustness such an application requires. \\n\\nOn the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget\\nabout NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats\\nthe purpose of using NT. Most of NT\\'s features are visible in a\\nnetworked environment and in such an environment you can\\'t reboot your\\nmachine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32\\nbased Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.\\nI expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32\\nbecomes widely available. \\n\\n--\\nSadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\\nCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computing\\ne-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu\\n',\n","  \"From: mz@moscom.com (Matthew Zenkar)\\nSubject: Re: CView answers\\nOrganization: Moscom Corp., E.

Since they aren\\'t fixed in position on their\\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\\ncontact with the trackball.

I just popped open one of our\\noffice\\'s PB170s, and while there isn\\'t as much latitude for movement, one\\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\\nhelp.\\n\\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \\nalcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.\\n\\nIf you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see\\nif it is actually causing the axle to spin. \\n\\nIf all this still doesn\\'t solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(\\nIt could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be\\nnecessary.

We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don\\'t think \\nParadox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok\\n(windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell\\nnetwork (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program\\nwill not load in 386 enchanted mode.

I\\'ve checked out the command.com\\nthing, but as a long-time C programmer, I\\'ve crashed my share of machines\\nwith pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)\\n\\nAnyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.

As far as the disk is\\nconcerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.\\nThe limit that causes the message, \"Windows will only use ...,\" is the\\namount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will\\ncreate, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have\\nwhen Windows starts.\\n\\nIn the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:\\n\\n\\tPageOverCommit=multiplier\\n\\nThe following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:\\n\\n\\tThis entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of\\n\\tlinear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is\\n\\tcomputed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to\\n\\tthe nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value\\n\\tspecified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the\\n\\tamount of available linear address space, causing the size of data\\n\\tstructures to increase.  This also increases paging activity\\n\\tproportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a\\n\\tvalue between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.

I think\\nwe\\'ll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\\nno \"option\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\\n\\'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\\nAnd there is the full \\'040 which you get when you order anything other\\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn\\'t\\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\\nIt\\'s not an \"option.\"\\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the \\'040 class chip cannot\\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\\nreplace the LC040 with a full \\'040. And if you have a C610, you will not\\nneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the\\nfull \\'040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\\n\\n-Hades\\n\\n',\n","  'From: maley@micro.cs.umn.edu (Michael P Maley)\\nSubject: Re: GUI Application Frameworks for Windows ??\\nNntp-Posting-Host: micro.cs.umn.edu\\nOrganization: University of Minnesota\\nLines: 6\\n\\nI look at zApp and really liked it.

Yes\\n(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 \\nrunning at 15.87 Mhz.\\n(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a \\nlot of memory.\\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \\nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \\nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \\nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \\nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \\nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \\nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \\n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \\nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \\naverage access time of about 25 ms.\\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \\nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \\nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \\nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\\n\\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \\nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \\nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \\n$650.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\\n\\n\\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\\n\\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\\n\\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\\n--  \\n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org\\n',\n","  \"From: rene@hardy.u.washington.edu (Rene Magritte)\\nSubject: Re: Win NT - what is it???\\nArticle-I.D.: shelley.1qnaesINNemf\\nOrganization: University of Washington\\nLines: 30\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hardy.u.washington.edu\\n\\nwild@access.digex.com (wildstrom) writes:\\n\\n>rmohns@vax.clarku.edu writes:\\n\\n>>Chicogo is what I want to use.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.

Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

Some\\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\\n\\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\\n\\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\\nbecause\\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\\nscanning\\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\\nsome machines).\\n\\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\\nonce\\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\\nwant to\\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\\nthe\\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\\nof\\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\\nwant\\nto make stereo sound.\\n\\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\\nthe\\nIBM don\\'t want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\\n\\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\\nhardware,\\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\\nworks.\\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\\n700/900/950\\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\\nonly.\\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\\nspecification,\\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\\n\\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\\n\\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn\\'t really related.\\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\\nmachine\\nyou have.\\n\\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\\n>Lemmings\\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\\n>Glider 4.0\\n>OIDS\\nand also\\nHellcats,\\nSuper Tetris\\nOxyd\\n(and many more, these are just what I\\'ve tested)\\n\\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\\n\\n\\nOther games you list:\\n>Armor Alley\\n>Spectre\\n>Spaceward Ho!\\nand also\\nPGA Tour Golf\\nCivilization\\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\\n\\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\\n\\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON\\'T CHEAT!\\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\\ndo,\\nbut I\\'m going say it anyway.\\nStop cheating on sound!\\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\\nis about to end.\\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\\nwork\\neven better soon, so use it.\\n\\nIn conclusion:\\nTo Doug, it isn\\'t a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\\nTo Jon, it isn\\'t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\\nsound\\nto both channels.

Windows will use a swap file\\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\\nthey handed out they have a section on \"Creating larger than recommended\\nswapfile\".  I\\'ll quote the information\\n\\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\\n  of RAM on your machine.\\n\\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\\ntelling you what little he knew.\\n\\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren\\'t actually\\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\\nI sprang for Word.\\n\\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone\\nwill go to a workshop and save a little money.\\n\\nAnd if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.\\nI need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)\\n\\nThanks,\\nBrent Casavant\\nbcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu\\n\\n',\n","  'From: dewinter@prl.philips.nl (Rob de Winter)\\nSubject: WANTED: Symantec address\\nOriginator: dewinter@prl.philips.nl\\nOrganization: Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, The Netherlands\\nLines: 5\\n\\n-- \\n*** Nothing beats skiing, if you want to have real fun during holidays. ***\\n***       Rob de Winter  Philips Research, IST/IT, Building WL-1        ***\\n***       P.O.

Any info or experience anyopne has would be\\ngreatly appreciated.\\n\\nWhen I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types\\nof sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH\\nspeakers:\\n\\nsystem beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)\\n\\nArmor Alley\\nSpectre\\nSpaceward Ho!\\n\\n\\nBut, the following games only play out of the left channel:\\n\\nLemmings\\nOut of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\\nGlider 4.0\\nOIDS\\n\\n\\nBut still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.\\n(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which\\nmy roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))\\n\\n\\nAll of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run\\nOOTW because he doesn't have color).\\n\\nWe're both running system 7.1\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get\\nsound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or\\ngreater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?\\n\\nI used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in\\nstereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be\\nmistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB\\n170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there\\nisn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are\\napparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they\\ncould just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of\\nboth speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?\\n\\nQuadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),\\nso maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1\\npatch over this problem?)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks for any help you can provide!\\n\\n\\nDoug Book\\ndpb@sdchemw2.ucsd.edu\\n\",\n","  \"From: folta@zen.holonet.net (Steve Folta)\\nSubject: Re: Using SetWUTime() with a PB170\\nNntp-Posting-Host: zen.holonet.net\\nOrganization: HoloNet National Internet Access System: 510-704-1058/modem\\nLines: 13\\n\\naep@world.std.com (Andrew E Page) writes:\\n>   I can get the mac to go to sleep, but I can't make seem to \\n>make it wake up with SetWUTime().\\n\\nThe PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

Alas, none of\\nthese have an FPU.\\n  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes\\nme now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and \"Quadra\" comparable\\nvideo speed.

The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\\nwake from sleep.\\n\\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\\n\\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\\n\\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\\ncompatible with the slower chips.\\n\\n     > Space.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.

(Around 5 MB.)\\n\\nI have a Quadra 950. \\nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\\n         (using block-mode transfers)\\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\\n\\nLet\\'s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\\n\\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\\n\\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \\n\\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\\n        ...\\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\\n\\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho\\')\\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers).

Some new\\ndrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data\\nwrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This\\nbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and\\nso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it\\nseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of\\nboosting the drive\\'s long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.\\n\\nI first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed\\nout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when\\ndigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk.

Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want\\nto install it.  I\\'ve been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.\\n\\n2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.\\n\\n3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.\\n\\n4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  \\n    i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt\\n\\n5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming\\nthey didn\\'t cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one\\nfile should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate\\nsaid offset in the original directory and see what\\'s there using a hex\\neditor, and do the same for the modified one.\\n\\n6.  You\\'re on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don\\'t\\nreally do cryptography.  It\\'s probably just an xor key or something; I\\nthink MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing\\nhis copy than with \"real pirates\" who will probably just disassemble\\nthe damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about\\nany obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original\\nfloppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able\\nto back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a\\ncompare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).\\n\\nAs I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and\\ndon\\'t do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one\\ndirectory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff\\nI\\'ve mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if\\nthey\\'d ever find out.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n","  'From: rda771v@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au (A.B.

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

The dataset is taken\\nfrom Fisher\\'s paper. Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n.. topic:: References\\n\\n   - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n     Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n     Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n   - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.
